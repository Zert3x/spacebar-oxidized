/* NOTES (bitfl0wer) [These will be removed]
The gateway is supposed to be highly concurrent. It will be handling a lot of connections at once.
Thus, it makes sense to have each user connection be handled in a separate task.

It is important to make a distinction between the user and the client. A user can potentially
be connected with many devices at once. They are still just one user. Respecting this fact
will likely save a lot of computational power.

Handling a connection involves the following steps:

1. Accepting the connection
2. Sending a hello event back
3. Receiving a Heartbeat event
4. Returning a Heartbeat ACK event
5. Receiving an Identify payload <- "GatewayUser" and/or "GatewayClient" are instantiated here.
6. Responding with a Ready event

Handling disconnects and session resumes is for later and not considered at this exact moment.

From there on, run a task that takes ownership of the Ga
